## Introduction

Macropads are small secondary keyboards that enable power users to boost their workflows for trading, programming, content creation, streaming, and even gaming with dedicated keys for keyboard shortcuts.

The objective of this project is to build a cheap but feature-rich and fully customizable macropad. 

A key project goal is to keep this extremely affordable as an entry-level macropad. The total cost including the PCB, Switches and Keycaps, a Pi Pico and the case should be under â‚¹1500 or sub-$20, which comes to under $1 per key. On a per-key basis, this might be one of the cheapest macropads in the world.

## Features

### Basic features

- 20 Programmable Keys
- RGB Underlighting
- Compact and Affordable

### Advanced features (in progress) 

- QMK Compatibility
- OLED I2C Display
- Buzzer
- Haptic Feedback

## Getting one

#### Pre-assembled Units
A few pre-assembled prototype units are available for review and purchase.

#### Component Kits
A few kits including PCB and components are available to buy. Basic soldering skills are needed; most components are through-hole however there is one single component (RGB LED) which needs SMD soldering.

#### Open Source Hardware
You can build this using the PCB files and Schematics from the repository. The cases can also be downloaded from the [hardware/case folder](hardware/rev%201/case/fdm-printable) for 3D-printing.
