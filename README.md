A Budget 20-Key Macropad that uses tactile mechanical keys and is based on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

A key project goal is to keep this extremely affordable as an entry-level macropad. The total cost including the PCB, Switches and Keycaps, a Pi Pico and the case should be under â‚¹1500 or sub-$20, which comes to under $1 per key.
